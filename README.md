Qusestion 21:
Assume we have a demand-paged memory. The page table is held in registers. It takes 8 ms to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replaced page is not modified , and 20 ms if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100 ns . Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 % of the time. Generate  a solution to find  the maximum acceptable page fault rate for an effective access time of no more than 200 nanoseconds.
